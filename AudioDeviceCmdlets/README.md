This is the C# part of the Source Code for the PowerShell module [AudioDeviceCmdlets](https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets).

This module was released as MIT license on day of copy: version 3.0.0.2
I have removed the PowerShell part, and starts to migrate and bugfix this code.

The original code referenced [System.Management.Automation_PowerShell_3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Management.Automation_PowerShell_3.0/) (6.3.9600.17400), that is unlisted.
"The owner has unlisted this package. This could mean that the package is deprecated, has security vulnerabilities or shouldn't be used anymore."

If we go to the last listed version of this package, we get: "This package has at least one vulnerability with high severity. It may lead to specific problems in your project. Try updating the package version."
