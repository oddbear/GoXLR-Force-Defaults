# Force Default Audio Devices for BEACN Mix Create

### NOTE: Orignally created for use with GoXLR but all functionality has been adapted to suit the BEACN Mix Create.


This service is made because Windows is quite eager to change the default sound devices. <br />
It will check every 5 seconds if this change has happened, and change this back.<br />
Additionally it will also set all the BEACN Devices to 100% Volume, and unmute them if detected.
